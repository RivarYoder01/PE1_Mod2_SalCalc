# CSC 365 Paired Programming #2 Planet_Distances
## Written by: Rivar Yoder and Hunter Schoch 
This program takes in the users hourly salary, the hours they work per week, the amount of days worked per week, the holidays off per year, and vacation days. The program will then give an unadjusted salary estimation where the hourly rate is multiplied by the hours worked per day and the average amount of work days per year (260). It will then give an adjusted number that subtracts the holidays and vacation days.
